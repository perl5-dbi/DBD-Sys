=head1 NAME

DBD::Sys::Plugin::Win32::Procs - provides a table containing running processes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $processes = $dbh->selectall_hashref("select * from procs", "pid");

=head1 ISA

  DBD::Sys::Plugin::Win32::Procs;
  ISA DBD::Sys::Table

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the table C<procs> for the MSWin32 compatible
environment (this might cover cygwin, too).

=head2 COLUMNS

=head3 pid

Process ID

=head3 ppid

Parent process ID

=head3 uid

UID of process

=head3 sess

Session ID

=head3 fulltime

User + system time

=head3 virtsize

Virtual memory size (bytes)

=head3 fname       

File name

=head3 start       

Start time (seconds since the epoch)

=head3 state       

State of process

=head3 cmndline

Full command line of process

=head3 threads      

Amount of threads used by this process

my ( $have_win32_process_info, $have_win32_process_commandline ) = ( 0, 0 );
eval { require Win32::Process::Info;        $have_win32_process_info        = 1; };
eval { require Win32::Process::CommandLine; $have_win32_process_commandline = 1; };

Win32::Process::Info->import( 'NT', 'WMI' ) if ($have_win32_process_info);
Win32::Process::CommandLine->import() if ($have_win32_process_commandline);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 getColNames

Returns the column names of the table as named in L</Columns>

=cut

sub getColNames() { @colNames }

=head2 getPrimaryKey

Returns 'pid' - which is the process identifier.

=cut

sub getPrimaryKey() { return 'pid'; }

=head2 collectData

Retrieves the data from L<Win32::Process::Info> and put it into fetchable rows.

{
    my $self = $_[0];
    my @data;

                  $procInfo->{SessionId} || 0,
                  $cli || $procInfo->{Name} || "<dead>",
                  $procInfo->{CreationDate},
                  int( ( $procInfo->{KernelModeTime} || 0 ) + ( $procInfo->{UserModeTime} || 0 ) + .499 ),
                  $procInfo->{VirtualSize} || $procInfo->{WorkingSetSize},
                  $procInfo->{ExecutablePath},
                  $procInfo->{_status} || $procInfo->{Status} || $procInfo->{ExecutionState},
                  $procInfo->{ThreadCount} || 1,
                );
        }
    }

    return \@data;
}

=head1 PREREQUISITES

The module L<Win32::Process::Info> is required to provide data for the
table. In rare cases, it could be useful to have
L<Win32::Process::CommandLine> installed, too.
