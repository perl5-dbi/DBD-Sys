=head1 METHODS

=head2 getColNames

Returns the column names of the table as named in L</Columns>

=cut

sub getColNames() { @colNames }

=head2 getPrimaryKey

Returns 'pid' - which is the process identifier.

=cut

sub getPrimaryKey() { return 'pid'; }

my %colMap = (
               fulltime => 'time',
               virtsize => 'size',
             );

sub _init_knownCols
{
    my $table = $_[0];
    unless ( 0 == scalar(@$table) )
    {
        %knownCols = map {
            defined $colMap{$_} or $colMap{$_} = $_;
            my $fn = $colMap{$_};
            $@ = undef;
            eval { $table->[0]->$fn() };
            $_ => ( $@ ? 0 : 1 )
        } @colNames;
    }
}

=head2 collectData

Retrieves the data from L<Proc::ProcessTable> and put it into fetchable rows.

=cut

sub collectData()
{
    my @data;

    if ($haveProcProcessTable)
    {
        my $pt    = Proc::ProcessTable->new();
        my $table = $pt->table();

        _init_knownCols($table) if ( 0 == scalar( keys %knownCols ) );

        foreach my $proc ( @{$table} )
        {
            my @row;

            #@row = (@$pt{@colNames});      # calls an error, proc::processtable bugged, handle as seen below.
            @row = map { my $fn = $colMap{$_}; $knownCols{$_} ? $proc->$fn() : undef } @colNames;

            push( @data, \@row );
        }
    }

    return \@data;
}

=head1 PREREQUISITES

The module L<Proc::ProcessTable> is required to provide data for the table.
