=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the table <filesysdf> which contains the free space
on file systems.

=head2 COLUMNS

=head3 mountpoint

The friendly name of the filesystem. This will usually be the same
name as appears in the list returned by the filesystems() method.

=head3 blocks

Total blocks existing on the filesystem.

=head3 bfree

Total blocks free existing on the filesystem.

=head3 bavail

Total blocks available to the user executing the Perl application.
This can be different than C<bfree> if you have per-user quotas on
the filesystem, or if the super user has a reserved amount.
C<bavail> can also be a negative value because of this. For instance
if there is more space being used then you have available to you.

=head3 bused

Total blocks used existing on the filesystem.

=head3 bper

Percent of disk space used. This is based on the disk space available
to the user executing the application. In other words, if the filesystem
has 10% of its space reserved for the superuser, then the percent used
can go up to 110%.

=head3 files

Total inodes existing on the filesystem.

=head3 ffree

Total inodes free existing on the filesystem.

=head3 favail

Total inodes available to the user executing the application.
See the information for the C<bavail> column.

=head3 fused

Total inodes used existing on the filesystem.

=head3 fper

Percent of inodes used on the filesystem.
See the information for the C<bper> column.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 getColNames

Returns the column names of the table as named in L</Columns>

=cut

sub getColNames() { return @colNames }

=head2 getAttributes

Return the attributes supported by this module:

=head3 blocksize

Allows to specify the blocksize of the returned free blocks.
This defaults to 1.

    $dbh->{sys_filesysdf_blocksize} = 512; # use UNIX typical blocksize for df

=cut

sub getAttributes() { return qw(blocksize) }

=head2 collectData

Retrieves the mountpoints of mounted file systems from L<Sys::Filesystem>
and determine the free space on their devices using L<Filesys::DfPortable>.
The mountpoint and the free space information are put in fetchable rows.

{
    my $self = $_[0];

        my @filesystems = $fs->filesystems( mounted => 1 );
        my $blocksize   = $self->{meta}->{blocksize} || 1;

        foreach my $filesys (@filesystems)
        {
            my @row;
            my $mountpt = $fs->mount_point($filesys);
            my $df = dfportable( $mountpt, $blocksize );
            if ( defined($df) )
            {
                @row = (
                        $fs->mount_point($filesys),
                        @$df{ 'blocks', 'bfree', 'bavail', 'bused', 'per', 'files', 'ffree', 'favail', 'fused', 'fper' }
                       );
            }
            else
            {
                @row = ( $fs->mount_point($filesys), (undef) x 10 );
            }
            push( @data, \@row );
        }
    }

    return \@data;
}

=head1 PREREQUISITES

L<Sys::Filesystem> and L<Filesys::DfPortable> are required in order to
fill the table C<filesysdf> with data.
